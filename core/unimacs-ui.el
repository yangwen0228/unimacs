;;; unimacs-ui.el --- Emacs Unimacs: UI optimizations and tweaks.
;;

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; We dispense with most of the point and click UI, reduce the startup noise,
;; configure smooth scolling and a nice theme that's easy on the eyes (solarized dark).

;;; Code:

;; the toolbar is just a waste of valuable screen estate
;; in a tty tool-bar-mode does not properly auto-load, and is
;; already disabled anyway. 0:show, -1:hide
(tool-bar-mode 0)

;; the blinking cursor is nothing, but an annoyance
(blink-cursor-mode -1)

;; disable startup screen
(setq inhibit-startup-screen t)

;; nice scrolling
(setq smooth-scroll-margin 0
      scroll-margin 0
      scroll-conservatively 1000
      scroll-preserve-screen-position t)

;; mode line settings
(line-number-mode t)
(column-number-mode t)
(size-indication-mode t)

;; make the fringe (gutter) smaller
;; the argument is a width in pixels (the default is 8)
(fringe-mode 4)

;; enable y/n answers
(fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)

;; more useful frame title, that show either a file or a
;; buffer name (if the buffer isn't visiting a file)
(setq frame-title-format
      '(" Unimacs - "
        (:eval (if (buffer-file-name)
                   (abbreviate-file-name (buffer-file-name))
                 "%b"))))

;; set the default theme
(load-theme 'solarized-dark t)

(provide 'unimacs-ui)
